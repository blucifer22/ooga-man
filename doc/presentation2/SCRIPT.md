# Sprint 1 Presentation

Start by showing off the features of your running program:

## Program Execution and Features
- Explain movement system - George
- Ghosts and their AI controls (and tests thereof) - George
- Show gameplay - George
- Show off grid/model demo data files (Marc)
- Show off JUnit tests for JSON stuff (Marc)
- Show data files for Themes (David)
- Show TestFX tests for SpriteView (David)


## Timeline/Plan - Franklin
- What we planned to complete this sprint
  - A basic implementation of "classic" Pac-Man
- What we actually completed this sprint
  - Most of what we wanted to accomplish
  - Implementation of the basic Pac-Man gameplay loop
  - (almost complete) implementation of Pac-Man level loading
  - Front-End themes loaded from disk
  - Level loading from disk
- Positive event: early integration of frontend/backend to ease testing
- Negative event: teammate getting acutely ill over the weekend.


## Team Communication - Matt
- What went well:
    - We were very communicative within the slack and having standing zoom meetings was good to help justify design decisions
- What didn't go as well:
  - We realized a lot of us wrote really large user cases (more like epics) that needed to frequently be subdivided
  - We had some initial miscommunication about how we were going to handle the git but they've since been resolved :)
- What we plan to do for improvement for next sprint:
  - Write better user cases

## Next Sprint - Matt
- Some outstanding items from this sprint
- Still need to finish the "complete" gameplay for the classic pacman
- Should be fine, though, since we planned for a lighter second sprint (which was essentially just supposed to be some basic extensions like Ms. Pac-Man)
- Frontend work -- extensions: create new themes, add new extension-added sprites to existing themes, polish up error handling.
- Backend work -- extensions: adding backend functionality for new sprites (i.e. the Ms. Pac-Man features), more advanced ghost AIs
