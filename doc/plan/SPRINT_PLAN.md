## Overall Plan
Team Responsibilities:
* Frontend:
    * David Coffman:
        * Running point on frontend
* Backend:
    * Franklin Wei:
        * Running point on backend
    * Marc Chmielewski:
        * Working with David to link frontend and backend
    * George Hong:
        * Running point on implementing movement and Ghost AI
    * Matthew Belissary:
        * Running point on assert acquisition and making sprites

In general, we plan to have David be the main programmer for frontend, George and Matthew to be the main backend programmers, and Marc and Franklin to mostly work on backend and interfacing with the frontend. This decision was made based off out preference and comfortability. These are, of course, just general divisions of labor, and if a team member needs assistance to meet a sprint goal, other team memebers will assist to ensure that all goals are met. The team will communicate via a slack channel, and a Trello board will be used to assign tasks as well as show teammates what has been completed and what is in progress.

## Sprint 1 Plan:
For the first spring, our main goals are to implement the classic Pac-Man game. This will require APIs that govern sprite movement, Ghost AI, game creation, powerups, and game visualization to be completed. The schedule for this week will be assigned to each teammate on Trello. The main priorities for this week will be get pac-man sprites moving on a gameboard and basic ghost and powerup interactions to be implmented. The backend model team (Marc and Franklin) will focus on making the model of the classic pac-man game and linking that with frontend. The backend movement team (George and Matthew) will define sprite movement as well as basic Ghost AI. Matthew will also work to acquire and create sprites and assets for the original pac-man game. David will work on allowing the frontend to create the gameboard to be visualized with the game (Marc will assist in intergrating frontend and backend).

## Sprint 2 Plan:
For the second spring, our main goals are to implement alternate game types. Trello and Slack will again be used to communicate team-member responsibilites as well as updating members and asking for assistance if needed. The backend model team (Marc and Franklin) will focus on allowing for the model to support multiple game types. The backend movement team (George and Matthew) will continue to refine movement as well as changing AI and movement patterns depending on the gametype. Matthew will also work to acquire and create sprites and assets to match different game types and themes to use. David will work on allowing the frontend to create the gametypes as specified by gamemode.
